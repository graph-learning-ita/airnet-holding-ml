abstract = {Flocking control is one of the important topics in multi-agent system (MAS), and has great value in both military and civilian applications. At present, the slow cluster consensus and poor control strategy in the stochastic environment are still serious problems faced by the flocking control algorithms. Focusing on the problems, we propose a leader-follower flocking algorithm based on a novel reinforcement learning (RL) model. We construct a homogeneous graph neural network (GNN) based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (herein HGNN-MADDPG) algorithm model for multi-agent flocking control system. In HGNN-MADDPG, we design a GNN with loss weight to complete the feature extraction of the structural information and improve the perception ability of agents to the system structure. Furthermore, in order to improve training efficiency, we also propose a new cooperative reinforcement learning architecture in which the network and experience between agents are shared. Simulation results show that the HGNN-MADDPG has a better learning effect and faster convergence than the traditional RL algorithms. In addition, the comparative experiments demonstrate the leader-follower flocking algorithm based on HGNN-MADDPG has a faster cluster consensus and more stable control than the traditional and other RL-based leader-follower algorithms in the stochastic environment.}

abstract = {Akamatsu et al. (2006) proposed a new transportation demand management scheme called “tradable bottleneck permits” (TBP), and proved its efficiency properties for a single bottleneck model. This paper explores the properties of a TBP system for general networks. An equilibrium model is first constructed to describe the states under the TBP system with a single OD pair. It is proved that equilibrium resource allocation is efficient in the sense that the total transportation cost in a network is minimized. It is also shown that the “self-financing principle” holds for the TBP system. Furthermore, theoretical relationships between TBP and congestion pricing (CP) are discussed. It is demonstrated that TBP has definite advantages over CP when demand information is not perfect, whereas both TBP and CP are equivalent for the perfect information case. Finally, it is shown that the efficiency result also holds for more general demand conditions.}

abstract = {With growing environmental concerns and tough carbon–neutral objectives, logistics providers have to consider not only economic benefits but also environmental impact in the delivery process. This study proposes a novel multi-objective optimization model for the vehicle routing problem with drone delivery. The proposed model involves improving delivery efficiency and reducing environmental impact by extending the conventional ground vehicle (i.e. truck) delivery model with the implementation of drone delivery as well as the optimization of the total energy consumption of trucks. Drones need to collaborate with trucks to serve customers because of their limited flight endurance. Moreover, the fact that flight endurance is dynamic and influenced by the loading rate of drones is also considered to satisfy practical application scenarios. An extended non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is presented to solve the proposed model. A new encoding and decoding method is incorporated to represent multiple feasible routes of drones and trucks, several crossover and mutation operators are integrated to accelerate the algorithmic convergence, and a multi-dimensional local search strategy is employed to enhance the diversity of population. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the presented algorithm is effective in obtaining high-quality non-dominated solutions by comparing it with three other baseline multi-objective algorithms.}

abstract="Recently, there has been a surge of interest, from both practitioners and academic researchers, that concerns the utilization of drones for civil applications. In this work, we are interested in studying the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRPD). In the VRPD, a fleet of vehicles, each of them equipped with a set of drones, is tasked with serving a given set of customers with minimal makespan. A drone may be launched from and recovered by its assigned vehicle and might move at a different velocity. However, compared to vehicles, drones possess a limited flight endurance and carrying capacity. The VRPD can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and, consequently, be solved by any standard MILP solver; however, only small-sized instances can be solved within a reasonable amount of time. Hence, for solving large-scale VRPD instances, we propose an algorithm based on Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS). We carried out extensive computational experiments and through our numerical results, we illustrate that drones might be beneficial with regards to a significantly reduced makespan.",

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gaining momentum in many civil and military sectors. An example is represented by the logistics sector, where UAVs have been proven to be able to improve the efficiency of the process itself, as their cooperation with trucks can decrease the delivery time and reduce fuel consumption. In this paper, we first state a mathematical formulation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) applied to logistic routing, where a truck cooperates synchronously with multiple UAVs for parcel delivery. Then, we propose, implement, and compare different sub-optimal routing approaches to the formulated mFSTSP (multiple Flying Sidekick Travelling Salesman Problem) since the inherent combinatorial computational complexity of the problem makes it unattractable for commercial Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers. A local search algorithm, two hybrid genetic algorithms that permutate feasible and infeasible solutions, and an alternative ad-hoc greedy method are evaluated in terms of the total delivery time of the output schedule. For the sake of the evaluation, the savings in terms of delivery time over the well-documented truck-only TSP solution are investigated for each proposed routing solution, and this is repeated for two different scenarios. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the results.},

In this system, truck and UAV operations are synchronized, i.e., one or more UAVs travel on a truck, which serves as a mobile depot. Deliveries can be made by both UAVs and the truck. While the truck follows a multi-stop route, each UAV delivers a single shipment per dispatch. The presented optimization model minimizes the waiting time of customers in the system. The model determines the optimal allocation of customers to truck and UAVs, the optimal route sequence of the truck, and the optimal launch and reconvene locations of the UAVs along the truck route. We formulate the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and conduct a bound analysis to gauge the maximum potential of the proposed system to reduce customer waiting time compared to a traditional truck-only delivery system. To be able to solve real-world problem size instances, we propose an efficient Truck and Drone Routing Algorithm (TDRA). The solution quality and computational performance of the mathematical model and the TDRA are compared together and with the truck-only model based on a variety of problem instances. Further, we apply the TDRA to a real-world case study for e-commerce delivery in São Paulo, Brazil. Our numerical results suggest significant reductions in customer waiting time to be gained from the proposed multi-modal delivery model.}

abstract = {Collaborative delivery employing drones in last-mile delivery has been an extensively studied topic in recent years. In this paper, it is studied Truck–Drone Delivery Problems (TDDPs) in which a traditional delivery truck is gathered with a drone to cut delivery times and costs. The vehicles work together in a hybrid operation involving one drone launching from a larger vehicle that operates as a mobile depot and a recharging platform. The drone launches from the truck with a single package to deliver to a customer. Each drone must return to the truck to recharge batteries, pick up another package, and launch again to a new customer location. This work proposes a novel Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation and a heuristic approach to address the problem. The proposed MIP formulation yields better linear relaxation bounds than previously proposed formulations for all instances, and was capable of optimally solving several unsolved instances from the literature. A hybrid heuristic based on the General Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic combining Tabu Search concepts is employed to obtain high-quality solutions for large-size instances. The efficiency of the algorithm was evaluated on 1415 benchmark instances from the literature, and over 80% of the best known solutions were improved.}

abstract = {In the multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF) we are given a set of agents each with respective start and goal positions. The task is to find paths for all agents while avoiding collisions. Most previous work on solving this problem optimally has treated the individual agents as a single ‘joint agent’ and then applied single-agent search variants of the A* algorithm. In this paper we present the Conflict Based Search (CBS) a new optimal multi-agent pathfinding algorithm. CBS is a two-level algorithm that does not convert the problem into the single ‘joint agent’ model. At the high level, a search is performed on a Conflict Tree (CT) which is a tree based on conflicts between individual agents. Each node in the CT represents a set of constraints on the motion of the agents. At the low level, fast single-agent searches are performed to satisfy the constraints imposed by the high level CT node. In many cases this two-level formulation enables CBS to examine fewer states than A* while still maintaining optimality. We analyze CBS and show its benefits and drawbacks. Additionally we present the Meta-Agent CBS (MA-CBS) algorithm. MA-CBS is a generalization of CBS. Unlike basic CBS, MA-CBS is not restricted to single-agent searches at the low level. Instead, MA-CBS allows agents to be merged into small groups of joint agents. This mitigates some of the drawbacks of basic CBS and further improves performance. In fact, MA-CBS is a framework that can be built on top of any optimal and complete MAPF solver in order to enhance its performance. Experimental results on various problems show a speedup of up to an order of magnitude over previous approaches.}

  abstract={Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental motion coordination problem arising in multi-agent systems with a wide range of applications. The problem's intractability has led to extensive research on improving the scalability of solvers for it. Since optimal solvers can struggle to scale, a major challenge that arises is understanding what makes MAPF hard. We tackle this challenge through a fine-grained complexity analysis of time-optimal MAPF on 2D grids, thereby closing two gaps and identifying a new tractability frontier. First, we show that 2-colored MAPF, i.e., where the agents are divided into two teams, each with its own set of targets, remains NP-hard. Second, for the flowtime objective (also called sum-of-costs), we show that it remains NP-hard to find a solution in which agents have an individually optimal cost, which we call an individually optimal solution. The previously tightest results for these MAPF variants are for (non-grid) planar graphs. We use a single hardness construction that replaces, strengthens, and unifies previous proofs. We believe that it is also simpler than previous proofs for the planar case as it employs minimal gadgets that enable its full visualization in one figure. Finally, for the flowtime objective, we establish a tractability frontier based on the number of directions agents can move in. Namely, we complement our hardness result, which holds for three directions, with an efficient algorithm for finding an individually optimal solution if only two directions are allowed. This result sheds new light on the structure of optimal solutions, which may help guide algorithm design for the general problem.},

abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive literature survey on facility location problems for drone (uncrewed vehicle) delivery, where either (i) drones are the only vehicles, or (ii) drones and other vehicles (e.g., trucks) work together for delivery, but drones do not ride in or on the other vehicles. The main goals of this review are to identify and categorize fundamental facility location problems associated with drone delivery, to document the large volume of research in this area, to provide a connection between the studies from different research fields that consider similar location problems, and to highlight promising areas for future research. We first discuss and classify the functions of drones and the various types of facilities used for drone and hybrid vehicle-drone (e.g., truck and drone, or transit and drone) delivery systems, including drone bases (fixed or temporary), other vehicle bases, recharging stations, (re)supply points, and platooning points. The literature is reviewed and categorized based on the types of vehicles involved and their interactions, the types of facilities located, the types of drones and the location space (discrete or continuous). Each category is analyzed in terms of the modeling approach, decision(s), the objective function(s), constraint(s) and additional feature(s). The paper concludes with some promising future research directions.}

abstract="This paper connects multi-agent path planning on graphs (roadmaps) to network flow problems, showing that the former can be reduced to the latter, therefore enabling the application of combinatorial network flow algorithms, as well as general linear program techniques, tomulti-agent path planning problems on graphs. Exploiting this connection, we show that when the goals are permutation invariant, the problem always has a feasible solution path set with a longest finish time of no more than n + V - 1 steps, in which n is the number of agents and V is the number of vertices of the underlying graph.We then give a complete algorithm that finds such a solution in O(nVE) time, with E being the number of edges of the graph. Taking a further step, we study time and distance optimality of the feasible solutions, show that they have a pairwise Pareto optimal structure, and again provide efficient algorithms for optimizing two of these practical objectives.",
