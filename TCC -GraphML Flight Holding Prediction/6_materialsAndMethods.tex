Our data is a lot imbalanced, but there is little work on imbalanced data in the literature for graph machine learning and most of the work is based on oversampling (\cite{GraphSmote} GRAPH SMOTE), however current literature shows that oversampling can lead to overfitting and poor generalization. In this work, we will deal with class imbalancing using undersampling for the GAT.  


% In this chapter, we present in the first two sections the methodologies of both methods we used to solve the LMDD problem. Further, we present the hybrid method, that unifies both approaches.
