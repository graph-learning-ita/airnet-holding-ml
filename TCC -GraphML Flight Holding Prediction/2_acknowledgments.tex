\begin{agradecimentos}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my family for helping me through this journey, specially my father, Jo√£o Luiz Franco, who always has encouraged my studies. Second, I express my gratitude to my advisor, Filipe Alves Neto Verri, for guiding me this semester and introducing me to this problem. Third, I would like to thank professor Vitor Venceslau Curtis, since this work would not be possible without his help. Last but not least, I express my gratitude to my fiance, Isis, for all the patience and caring during this time, my friends for the support, and God who never abandoned me.
