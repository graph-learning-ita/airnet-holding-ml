This chapter details the materials and methods used in our
study. Specifically, we will cover the dataset, the model based on
CatBoost using graph-derived features, and our approach using Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) for predictive modeling. Our dataset
includes a range of meteorological, geographical, and flight
variables.

Our objective is to detail and model how to predict if a given
aircraft is going to delay due to holding maneuver in a supervised
learning setting.

\section{Datasets}
\label{Datasets}

The study utilizes two distinct datasets, each containing 42,336
observations, with identical meteorological, geographical, and
flight-related features. These datasets were constructed from a
combination of METAR and METAF weather reports, airport and flight
specifications sourced from ICEA. Each dataset serves a different
predictive modeling purpose—binary classification and regression—and
includes tailored labels to reflect these objectives

One of the primary challenges in the classification dataset is its
class imbalance, which could impact model performance. Common
approaches to address imbalance, such as oversampling or
undersampling, have been shown to introduce limitations like
overfitting and poor generalization (\cite{zhao2021graphsmote}, Graph
SMOTE). For graph machine learning tasks, oversampling is generally
problematic due to the risk of introducing artificial connectivity
patterns, while undersampling can lead to loss of critical structural
information. Therefore, we opted to explore model-based techniques
without applying these rebalancing methods.

\subsection{Binary Classification Dataset} The binary classification
dataset is used to predict the likelihood of a holding maneuver
occurring for a given flight. In this dataset, the label is a binary
value:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class 0 (No Holding)}: Represents flights with no
    holding delays, comprising 41,616 samples.
    \item \textbf{Class 1 (Holding)}: Indicates flights with holding
    delays, comprising only 720 samples.
\end{itemize} This significant imbalance between the classes adds
complexity to the classification task, as the model needs to
accurately predict a rare event within the data.

\subsection{Regression Dataset} The regression dataset aims to predict
the exact duration of holding delays in seconds, thus providing a
continuous label for each observation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Holding Time (Seconds)}: For this dataset, each
    holding event is represented by a floating-point number indicating
    the holding time in seconds. This approach enables a finer-grained
    analysis and can potentially improve operational insights by
    quantifying delay duration rather than merely classifying its
    occurrence.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Meteorological Features} The dataset includes a
comprehensive range of meteorological variables from both METAR and
METAF reports:

    \texttt{metaf\_current\_wx2\_symbol},
    \texttt{metaf\_current\_wx3\_symbol}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Geographical Features} The geographical features include
variables based on flight paths and airport information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flight Distance:} Calculated as the geodesic
    distance between departure and arrival airports.
    \item \textbf{Airport Altitude:} \texttt{departure\_altitude} and
    \texttt{arrival\_altitude}, reflecting the elevation of the
    airports.
    \item \textbf{Latitude and Longitude:}
    \texttt{departure\_latitude}, \texttt{departure\_longitude},
    \texttt{arrival\_latitude}, and \texttt{arrival\_longitude} for
    geolocation-based analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Flight-Specific Features} These features capture specific
characteristics related to the flight and any runway head changes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Previous Runway Head Change:}
    \texttt{prev\_troca\_cabeceira}
    \item \textbf{Runway Head Change in Previous Hour:}
    \texttt{troca\_cabeceira\_hora\_anterior}
    \item \textbf{Flight Hour:} \texttt{hora\_do\_voo}
\end{itemize}
