# Compilation warning


To ensure proper compilation according to the project's
Makefile rules, all documents must be processed using at least the
2024 TeX Live distribution. The default TeX Live distribution included
with Ubuntu 22.04 is the 2021 version, which is insufficient and will
lead to incorrect results.

For installation instructions and more information, please visit: [TeX Live Quick Install Guide](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html#running).
